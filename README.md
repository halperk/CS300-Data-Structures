# CS 300 - Data Structures

**Course Description:** The objective of the course is to introduce fundamental techniques of algorithm analysis, to introduce common data structures, their properties and implementation and to apply C++ programming skills to implement solutions using common data structures to practical problems.
 And, these are my homeworks in this course in the Spring 2021-2022 term at Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey.

### Homework Topics:

- **Homework 1:** Stack, Linked List
- **Homework 2:** AVL Search Tree, Binary Search Tree 
- **Homework 3:** Binary Search Tree, Hash Table
- **Homework 4:** Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Sequential Search, Binary Search

### Course Topics:
- Algorithm Complexity Analysis
- Linear Data Structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
- Trees (Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Tree Traversals)
- Hash Tables
- Heaps (Priority Queues)
- Disjoint Sets
- Sorting (Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Graph Data Structures (Representation, Depth-First and Breadth-First Search)
